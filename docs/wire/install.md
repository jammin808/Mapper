# wp3-installer on the wire

*Generated from the catalogue by `tools/gen_stubs3.py`; the package owns this file and keeps it to what it ships. A row is
answered "not available on this node yet" until the package routes it, and `VERBS` marks it `"available"` once it is;
a form added to an existing row is refused by that row's handler with the forms that work, and changes nothing.*

## Verbs

## Forms added to existing rows

None.

## STATE

`machine.install`: `installed`, `msi` (the installer's version, MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD), `dir`, `supervised`, `showUser`, `supervisor`
(`state` — waiting-for-session, starting, running, stopping, backoff, stopped-too-many-restarts or held — `pid`, `restarts`,
`lastCause`, `freezeRule`, `at`; null when no status file is read), `autoLogon` (`on`, `user`; never a password), `edition`, `signed`,
`light`, `words`. Read from `HKLM\SOFTWARE\PlayMap`, Winlogon's `AutoAdminLogon` and `DefaultUserName`, and the supervisor's
`status.json`, at most every two seconds. A folder run: `installed` false, `supervisor` null.

## Preflight

Section `install`: `install:installed` (a folder run amber on a node whose project drives an enabled output, grey elsewhere),
`install:supervisor` (red once it stopped trying, with `PlayMap.Supervisor.exe resume` in words; the freeze rule waiting for shown
frames as information), `install:autologon` (amber off on a supervised node), `install:policies` and `install:signed` (information
rows: grey, value `i`). The check is `Install/InstallPreflight.cs`; the exe's composition registers it once the spine's
`AddInstallParts` hook lands (until then tests register it through the services).

## Papers note

The node installs per machine with an Inno Setup installer (the self-built WiX tool asks for its licence gesture, never given), with
the supervisor service, firewall rules, WER dumps, the event source and the show account's right done by the supervisor's commands;
unsigned builds named `-unsigned` with `SHA256SUMS`; the installer's version MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD; an install refused while armed or
while a live engine does not answer. `docs/INSTALL.md` is the person's guide.
